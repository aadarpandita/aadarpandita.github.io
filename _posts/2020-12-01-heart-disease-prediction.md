Medical organisations, all around the world, collect data on various health related issues. This data can be exploited using various machine learning techniques to gain useful insights. But the data collected is very massive and, many times, this data can be very noisy. These datasets, which are too overwhelming for human minds to comprehend, can be easily explored using various machine learning techniques. Thus, these algorithms have become very useful, in recent times, to predict the presence or absence of heart related diseases accurately.
